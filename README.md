# eskarpnes.github.io
My personal website/portfolio

# The method
This page is made with the npm module gh-pages, which lets me develop the page in React and compile it to static code that
github pages can host. The master branch only contains compiled code (as github pages can only host on the master branch).

# The code
If you are looking for the code used in this project, you should check out the develop branch. It contains the source-code.
